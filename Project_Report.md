# Fish Weight Prediction – Project Report

---

## 1. Introduction
Fish weight prediction is an important application of regression in machine learning.  
It helps in fisheries management, pricing, and quality assessment.

---

## 2. Problem Definition
Predict the weight of a fish using its physical measurements and species.

---

## 3. Dataset Overview
The dataset contains physical attributes of various fish species including length, height, and width.

---

## 4. Data Preprocessing
- Checked missing values
- Encoded categorical data
- Selected relevant features

---

## 5. Model Building
A Linear Regression model was trained using training data.

---

## 6. Evaluation
The model was evaluated using:
- R² Score
- Mean Squared Error
- Mean Absolute Error

---

## 7. Conclusion
The regression model successfully predicts fish weight with good accuracy.

---

## 8. Future Scope
- Try Polynomial Regression
- Apply Random Forest Regression
- Build a web app for predictions
