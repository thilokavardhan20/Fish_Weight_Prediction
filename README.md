# Fish Weight Prediction using Machine Learning (Python)

This project predicts the **weight of a fish** based on its physical measurements using **regression models**.  
It is a classic **supervised machine learning regression problem**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Given physical attributes of a fish such as length, height, width, and species, predict the **weight of the fish** accurately.
